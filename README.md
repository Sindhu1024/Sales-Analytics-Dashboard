## 📈 Dashboard Breakdown & Key Insights

### **1. Sales Overview Dashboard**
- Sales showed **strong growth from 2003 to 2004**, followed by a decline in 2005.
- Possible reasons include partial-year data or reduced demand.
- Seasonal trends show stronger sales mid-year.

### **2. Product Performance Dashboard**
- **Classic Cars** is the **top-performing product line**, with high pricing power and stable demand.
- **Price vs. Quantity Insight**: Quantity ordered is similar across product lines, so **price positioning is the main revenue driver**, not volume.
- Value-tier products (like Trains and Vintage Cars) are ideal entry-level offerings to attract new customers.

### **3. Regional Insights Dashboard**
- **USA** is the dominant market, generating the highest share of revenue.
- **Spain and France** form a strong secondary cluster.
- Lower-performing regions may benefit from distributor partnerships or tailored marketing strategies.

### **4. Customer Insights Dashboard**
- **Medium-sized deals contribute the majority of revenue**, indicating strong recurring mid-tier customer activity.
- Large deals are less frequent but impactful, suggesting potential to grow enterprise-level accounts.
